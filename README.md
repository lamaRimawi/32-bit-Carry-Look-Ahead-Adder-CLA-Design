## 🏗️ Architecture Overview

### Design Philosophy

The Carry Look-Ahead Adder eliminates the linear carry propagation delays inherent in Ripple Carry Adders (RCA) by precomputing carry signals in parallel. This approach significantly reduces critical path delay and improves overall performance.

### Key Mathematical Foundation

**Carry Generation and Propagation:**
```
Ck+1 = Gk + Pk · Ck

Where:
- Gk = Generate signal (Ak · Bk)
- Pk = Propagate signal (Ak ⊕ Bk)
- Ck = Carry input to the k-th stage
```

**Full Adder Equations:**
```
Sk = (Ak ⊕ Bk) ⊕ Ck
Ck+1 = (Ak · Bk) + ((Ak ⊕ Bk) · Ck)
```
